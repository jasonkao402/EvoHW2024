**(a) Writing Quality:**  
The writing is clear and organized, with proper grammar and sentence structure. However, a few minor improvements could enhance readability. For example, the paper's title and sections like "Insert Your Title Here" could be finalized to better reflect professionalism. The use of technical terms is accurate but could benefit from more accessible explanations for broader audiences.

**(b) Problem Specification:**  
The problem is well-defined, focusing on optimizing CNN architectures using genetic algorithms (GAs). The prerequisites and goals are clearly outlined, particularly the constraints on CNN layers and GA configurations.

**(c) Achievement of Objectives:**  
The paper achieves its stated objectives by proposing a GA-based method, evaluating different configurations, and identifying an optimal setup. However, while the F1 score of 0.784 and validation loss of 0.585 are decent, they might not represent state-of-the-art performance, which should be acknowledged in the discussion.

**(d) Strengths & Weaknesses:**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Systematic approach to defining and solving the problem.  
  - Clear explanations of GA operations (selection, crossover, mutation).  
  - Detailed experiments with various configurations.  
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - The methodology assumes fixed non-convolutional layers, limiting the exploration scope.  
  - Performance metrics could be compared to existing approaches to contextualize the results.  
  - Figures like convergence curves are included but not thoroughly analyzed.  

**(e) Contributions:**  
The paper contributes a novel application of GAs to CNN architecture optimization for CIFAR-10. The layer-wise crossover and mutation operations are innovative, and the study highlights the importance of population size and selection methods in GA performance.

**(f) Suggestions:**  
1. **Title and Presentation:** Finalize placeholders like "Insert Your Title Here" for better professionalism.  
2. **Comparison:** Include comparisons with other optimization techniques, like grid search or Bayesian optimization, to provide context for the GA's performance.  
3. **Figures and Analysis:** Expand the discussion around figures like convergence curves to draw deeper insights.  
4. **Future Work:** Highlight areas for improvement, such as exploring non-convolutional layers or applying the method to other datasets.  

**(g) Reasons for Recommendation:**  
I would assign this paper a grade of **7/10**. While it is well-written and methodologically sound, it lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and a deeper analysis of results. Addressing these gaps would strengthen the paper and its contributions to the field.
