### 1. Term Project Status
- **Completed Tasks**:
  - Initialization of the game environment using Pygame.
  - Implementation of physic system, such as player movement and ball collision detection. 
  - Implementation of simple scoring functions for both attacking and defending players, under manual mode.
- **Pending Tasks**:
  - Testing and fine-tuning the co-evolution for the two teams to properly evolve.
  - Still designing the scoring functions for the two teams to ensure balanced gameplay.

### 2. Discussion on Project Status
- **Difficulties**:
  - **Scoring Functions**: Fine-tuning the scoring functions to ensure realistic and balanced gameplay is quite challenging as this requires extensive trial and error to achieve the desired results.

### 3. Miscellaneous Items
- **Difficultie reduction**: I might plan to fall back to a simpler one team evolution strategy to reduce the complexity of the game environment and scoring functions, as fine-tuning two teams simultaneously is quite challenging.
