# Express your current views on diversity, such as definition, importance, etc. What are your observations of genetic diversity in nature and in EC? Does it really matter?
Diversity is essential in both natural evolution and evolutionary computation. In nature, genetic diversity acts as a buffer against environmental changes, reducing the risk of extinction. In evolutionary computation, diversity is crucial for exploring the search space and avoiding premature convergence. 

# People often see diversity in nature as creative. Do you think machine algorithms can claim to be creative too? Why or why not?
Machine algorithms sure can generate unseen and surprising solutions to problems, which would be considered creative in human terms. However, I would say that machine algorithms are creative, but not creative in the same sense as humans. They express creativity in unexpected and unpredictable ways, while humans can create based on mind flow, emotions, and life experiences.

# Select four direct quotes or ideas, each from a different lecture above and explain how they expand or influence your current view of EC.

## Quotes 1: "To take full advantage of evolutionary computation though, you have to embrace some unpredictability." [Evolutionary computation, Keith Downing, 12:37]
Explanation: It reminds me that the randomness in EC is not a bug but a feature. Sometimes, you dont have to define everything in detail, you just have to let the evolution figure out the best solution on its own.

## Quotes 2: "The viewer perceives what they want in the forms, and the forms have no meaning of their own." [Evolutionary Art and Computers, William Latham, 5:00]
Explanation: It makes me think about the subjectivity of art and creativity. The actions and results of EC can be perceived differently by different people. Humans try to interpret the results with a "connect the dots" mindset, which is unique to each individual and probably  oversimplified from the algorithm's perspective.

## Quotes 3: "We do not learn as individuals, we learn and evolve as a population." [Where is Number 17: The Evolution of Computer Intelligence, Ziad Kobti, 8:07]
Explanation: In EC, the population work together to find the best solution. Each individual in the population can contribute to the overall success of the population, even if they are not the best solution themselves. This is similar to how humans learn and evolve as a society.

## Quotes 4: "It's quite likely that the simulation isn't a very accurate representation of the real world, but it has an advantage that it enables models of robots to be created and tested in seconds rather than hours." [Self-Assembling Robots and the Potential of Artificial Evolution, Emma Hart, 8:06]
Explanation: I would say the benefit is not only the speed but also the degree of control. Having to define the environment and constraints in EC can be challenging, but it also allows for more controlled experiments and faster iterations compared to real-world testing.
